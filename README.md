# odin-landing-page
The landing page project from The Odin Project's fundamentals

## About
This project is meant to practice creating a page from scratch using CSS and more specifically flexbox. The layout of the page is not mine; I recreated the template given to me by The Odin Project.

## Use
The page can be accessed online [here](DAlexFunk.github.io/odin-landing-page) through GitHub Pages.

## Credits
[The Odin Poject](https://www.theodinproject.com) for teaching the skills necessary to complete it and for providing the basic layout of the page.
